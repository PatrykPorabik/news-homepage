## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From highlights:
I've used CSS Grid for the first time. In the past I was doing templates only with flexbox. I've found Grid very useful, it's easy to use and can ease up the whole work with more complicated grids. 

### Continued development

In the next challenges I want to focus more on the website semantic, accessibility and creating better CSS code.

### Useful resources

- [Hamburger menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWn7kP-QoNw) - This helped me create a hamburger menu. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
